I'm trying to share my life experiences and be really honest. That sounds really scary.
Including 5 of my personal revelations.
In 1998, on Gold Coast of Brisbane: a loud voice told me: "It is not God that I worshipped in all churches I've been to. I bursted into crying and sadness.
About 10 years ago, I was deeply lost in my life. I had bad depression at that time and not been diagnosed yet. That's when I was in colledge. I was used to be doing good in my life. But a thought puzzled me very much. That is "what is the purpose of my life?"
I met my wife.
The real status of our money. Gambling in stock market. Our life turned from giving money to our relatives, to borrowing money from our relatives.
The day before two missionaries knotted our door. It's like you know someone is going to propose to you. You just know something big is going to happen and change your life forever, but you don't know what and how it will happen.
The vision of Moroni, Joseph Smith, and gold plates.
The quest to Salt Lake City. The place.
Prophets always tell us to serve in a mission. I just learned why. As far as I know, a lot of homeless people in Salt Lake City, is actually richer than a lot of members in my ward in Taiwan. It's the truth. The poverty line is about $25,000 a year of income here. However, that income is higher than the average income of a manager level job in Taiwan. And the house price in Taiwan is much higher. If any one of you have a doubt that you are not successful enough, you really should go serve in a country that much poor than here. After you really see how other people struggle in their life, you will forget all your problems right away.
